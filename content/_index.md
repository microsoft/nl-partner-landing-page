# Welcome to the Microsoft Netherlands Partner Tech Hub

### The one-stop destination for uplifting your Azure Data & AI journey

This project is managed by the Data & AI Partner Tech team of Microsoft Netherlands. Our goal is gathering all valuable resources in one single place to support you as a Microsoft Partner. With this landing page, we are trying to assist you in your complete partner journey, bringing together partnership information, Microsoft programs, and technical resources. We plan to expand to other solution areas in the future as well, but for the moment the technical content is targeted on the Data & AI domain.

### Your guided journey to success

In the left menu, you will find your way to navigate all sections we prepared for you. You can expect to find the following:

**Step 1: Getting Started**
We created an entire section for companies that are new to the concept of partnering with Microsoft. You will find all the information you need on how to become a Microsoft partner and which are the benefits you will get access to. 

**Step 2: Explore Data & AI tech resources**
We built a collection of technical documentation about Azure Data & AI stack that you can use to upskill around topics like data governance, cloud analytics, and generative AI.

**Step 3: Partner Programs, Sales Enablement and certifications**
Learn more about Partner programs to get funding from  Microsoft, explore what it means to co-sell with us and learn more about Azure certifications and partner specializations.
