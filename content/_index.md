In the belux site, we chose to set up this site in this way. Your needs might be different and because of that I really encourage you to modify/update the site to suit it to your needs (incl layout)

Have Fun!

## Hello and welcome to the Microsoft BeLux Partner TechTeam Journey Hub

This initiative is in preview towards Microsoft Partners. It is an exercise of the Microsoft Belgium & Luxembourg Partner Tech Team to explore new ways to help our partners become even more successful.  It is this important to understand that: 

1. This site is in preview and might still miss information.
2. We welcome constructive feedback and suggestions to improve.

This site can be seen as a hub where we bring many of the Microsoft programs, products & technical resources together. To make this tangible for you, as a partner, we have structured the content "solution area"-specific journeys. We hope it will accelerate your Partner journey to deliver the best possible Customer experience.
