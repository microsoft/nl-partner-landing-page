## Why Partner Admin Link?
Setting up customer associations is crucial for partner recognition for their work in relation to Microsoft. This practice is worth integrating your partner business operations as it helps align businesses, offers recognition, and raises the potential of working closer together.

When associations per workload are established, Microsoft can better recognize, collaborate, and support customers with the right partners, like you! Microsoft has been expanding cloud competency requirements with **Partner Admin Link registrations**, differentiating transactional and embracing non-transactional and non-tech partners that provide services and intellectual property related to Microsoft solutions. To set up PAL, partners need Partner Center access and specific admin rights.
