## Build and publish your solution on the Marketplace

At Microsoft we love to work with partners. Our entrance point for collaboration is our sales motions starting with [referrals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals") to become co-sell opportunities.

The referrals you share (requirement 3 out of 4 BANT-criteria) will land with our sales teams. In Partner Center you can set up the referral and [ask for help from the account team to support the customer together](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-overview "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-overview").

To start co-selling, partners need an MPN membership, access to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/ "https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/"), a [business profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/create-a-marketing-profile "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/create-a-marketing-profile"), a [commercial-ready solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure"), an engaged sales team, and a strong go-to-market strategy. This year you will also need a solution designation within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program or take part in the [ISV program](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/independent-software-vendor-resources#/ "https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/independent-software-vendor-resources#/"). The required commercial-ready solution has to be [published](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type") at Microsoft commercial marketplace in at least one of the two main online stores:

-   [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/ "https://appsource.microsoft.com/") for business solutions
-   [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/ "https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/") for IT solutions

1.  Get co-sell ready by creating a plan and engaging internal stakeholders. Utilize resources like Partner Center for setting up your solution and Partner Center Docs for guidance.
2.  Manage your [business profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/create-a-marketing-profile "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/create-a-marketing-profile") to help Microsoft sales leads find you and receive [referrals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals").

3. Create your [co-sell solution listing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure") and review the resources at [Microsoft Azure IP co-sell resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/microsoft-azure-ip-co-sell-resources#/ "https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/microsoft-azure-ip-co-sell-resources#/")

4. Involve sales by registering new deals and sharing leads with Microsoft. Create ownership of sales ambitions and assign a sales champ as a co-sell expert.

5. Review your success by keeping opportunities up to date and monitoring collaboration progress.
