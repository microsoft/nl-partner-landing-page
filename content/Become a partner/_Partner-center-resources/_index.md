## Build and publish your solution on the Marketplace
At Microsoft we love to work with partners. Our entrance point for collaboration is our sales motions starting with [<u>referrals</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals) to become co-sell opportunities.

The referrals you share (requirement 3 out of 4 BANT-criteria) will land with our sales teams. In Partner Center you can set up the referral and [<u>ask for help from the account team to support the customer together</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-overview).

### Get started
To start co-selling, partners need an MPN membership, access to [<u>Partner Center</u>](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/), a [<u>business profile</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/create-a-marketing-profile), a [<u>commercial-ready solution</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure), an engaged sales team, and a strong go-to-market strategy. This year you will also need a solution designation within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program or take part in the [<u>ISV program</u>](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/independent-software-vendor-resources#/). The required commercial-ready solution has to be [<u>published</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type) at Microsoft commercial marketplace in at least one of the two main online stores:

-   [<u>Microsoft AppSource</u>](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) for business solutions
-   [<u>Azure Marketplace</u>](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) for IT solutions

### Step-by-step
**1.**  Get co-sell ready by creating a plan and engaging internal stakeholders. Utilize resources like Partner Center for setting up your solution and Partner Center Docs for guidance.

**2.**  Manage your [<u>business profile</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/create-a-marketing-profile) to help Microsoft sales leads find you and receive [<u>referrals</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals).

**3.** Create your [<u>co-sell solution listing</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-configure) and review the resources at [<u>Microsoft Azure IP co-sell resources</u>](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/microsoft-azure-ip-co-sell-resources#/)

**4.** Involve sales by registering new deals and sharing leads with Microsoft. Create ownership of sales ambitions and assign a sales champ as a co-sell expert.

**5.** Review your success by keeping opportunities up to date and monitoring collaboration progress.

For independent software vendors, discuss your readiness and next steps with the ISV team! Book a Teams meeting with the local ISV team. They are eager to guide you and help you succeed.ðŸš€ [<u>https://lnkd.in/eMjVyMhn</u>](https://lnkd.in/eMjVyMhn)
