# Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks is a unified set of tools for building, deploying, sharing, and maintaining enterprise-grade data solutions at scale. The Azure Databricks Lakehouse Platform integrates with cloud storage and security in your cloud account, and manages and deploys cloud infrastructure on your behalf. You can use it to build and deploy data engineering workflows, machine learning models, analytics dashboards, and more.

Databricks has revolutionized the industry by embracing open-source format with [<u>delta</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/introduction/delta-comparison) and inventing the [<u>lakehouse architecture</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/) which is now the state-of-the-art framework for Azure Analytics customers.

As partners, we encourage you to explore Databricks material and courses published in their [<u>partner academy</u>](https://partner-academy.databricks.com/learn) and learn [<u>the best practices for implementation on Azure</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/best-practices/azure-databricks-implementation).
