# Microsoft Partner Tech Hub Netherlands

This repository will be used for the development and maintenance of the landing page for Microsoft partners in The Netherlands.

The main goal is to _centralize_ all relevant information for partners, such as:

- ðŸš€ typical partner journey
- ðŸ“– relevant Microsoft resources
- ðŸ“… events targeting the NL subsidiary

This initiative will initially target the **Data & AI** domain, and will eventually scale later on for other solution areas.
